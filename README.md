# healthcare-revenue-cycle-analysis
Analyzed hospital claims data to identify inefficiencies in the revenue cycle and provide recommendations to improve billing accuracy and operational efficiency.

## 🏥 Business Problem
Hospitals often lose revenue due to billing delays, claim denials, and inefficient processing.  
This project aims to uncover these inefficiencies using data analytics.

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized formats, and organized claim data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends, anomalies, and high-risk claim categories.  
3. **Visualization:** Created dashboards and visuals to communicate key findings clearly.  
4. **Recommendations:** Suggested process improvements for billing workflows.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain claim types took 20% longer to process than average.  
- A few hospitals contributed disproportionately to denied claims.  
- Automating repeat claims could improve overall processing time.

## 🧠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Excel
- Tableau Public
- GitHub for project hosting

## 📈 Results
- Identified potential savings opportunities through process optimization.  
- Developed visual dashboards to track performance and denial rates.
